### Project Overview
#### This dashboard has been developed to visualize of ongoing project health across several regions in Africa. The dashboard provides data in three categories: project priority, project progress, and project status.


### Data Sources
#### The primary dataset used for this dashboard was sourced from the PBI Learning Project. 


### Tools
#### 1. Microsoft Excel: Data Cleaning
#### 2. Power Bi: Query, Data Analysis, Visualisation.


### Results
#### This dashboard is divided into three slicers: projects that need attention, projects that are not set, and projects that are on track. Each slicer provides data on the budget, the number of ongoing projects, project priorities in each construction, and project progress.
